Before using the Braintree ZRA Smart Invoice Connector, you need to set up and configure the system. This involves:

- Installing the extension in your Business Central environment
- Configuring the system settings, such as the ZRA tax code and integration setup
- Setting up user accounts and permissions

>The following system settings need to be configured.

### <a name="_toc178688688"></a>Integration Setup

1. Open the ZRA Integration Setup menu.
2. Select the **Integration Service Provider**
3. Confirm that the **Target API URL** is correct for the Service Provider
4. Enter the following fields 
    1. **API Key**
    2. **SDC ID**
5. Lastly, **Enable** the integration
6. If you want to host the list of commodity codes locally in the database, you can leave the **Use Web Service for commodity lookup** field disabled. Not all service providers do, but if the chosen Service Provider does support commodity code lookup, you can enable this feature.

#### Additional Integration Setup fields:

- **Prefix on Purchase Description**: Adds the line sequence number as a prefix to Purchase Line descriptions.
- **Prefix on Sales Description**: Adds the line sequence number as a prefix to Sales Line descriptions.
- **Purch. Accept Duplicate Response**: Treats duplicate purchase invoice responses from Fiscal Edge as successful integrations. (The purchase api sometimes responds with a duplicate response even when the integration was successful, this setting allows the system to treat those responses as successful integrations instead of failed ones.)

### <a name="_toc178688689"></a>Commodity Codes

Description of fields:

- **Code**: Unique identifier, used by most Service Providers
- **Value**: A secondary identifier, used by some Service Providers.
- **Blocked**: *Not used yet, reserved for future use.* 
- **Requires recommended Retail Price**: When enabled, requires items to be registered with a recommended retail price when this code is used on a transaction.

### <a name="_toc178688695"></a>User Management 
Two Permission Sets have been added:

1. ZRA ALL BTR – For administrators of the integration, that are allowed to change the configuration.
2. ZRA BASIC BTR – For all other users, so that the integration can happen in the background.

>The system also maintains a list of users and assigns a unique integer to each user as required by the ZRA interface. This should not require any maintenance by an administrator.
